# Notes and Adjustments
# Go-based Application: You need to replace ./go-app with the path to your Go application and main.go with the name of your Go program entry point.
# Apache Kafka: This setup includes Zookeeper, which Kafka requires to run. Adjust environment variables as necessary for your Kafka setup.
# MariaDB: Replace rootpassword with a secure root password and mydatabase with your desired database name.
# Postfix Container: This uses catatnight/postfix, a simple image for Postfix. Customize the maildomain and smtp_user with your domain and desired SMTP user credentials. Note that running a mail server involves additional configuration for security and deliverability, which is beyond this basic setup.
# Python Container: Replace ./python-app with the path to your Python application and main.py with your Python program entry point.
# Volumes: A persistent volume for MariaDB is defined to ensure data persistence. Ensure volume paths and configurations align with your project structure and storage requirements.
# Networks: By default, Docker Compose sets up a single network for your app's services to communicate with each other. If you need isolated networks or custom configurations, you can define them under a networks key.
# Security: This configuration includes default passwords and configurations for simplicity. For production environments, ensure you use secure passwords, consider network configurations, and review each service's security best practices.
# After creating this docker-compose.yml, you can start all services with docker-compose up and stop them with docker-compose down. Remember, this file is a starting point, and further customization might be necessary to fit your specific project requirements.
